            JavaScript is a high-level programming language that follows the ECMAScript standard. It was originally designed as a scripting language for websites but became widely adopted as a general-purpose programming language, and is currently the most popular programming language in use.[1] JavaScript is usually found running in a web browser as interactive or automated content, ranging from popup messages and live clocks to large web applications. JavaScript is also commonly used in server-side programming through platforms like Node.js,[2] or "embedded" in non-JavaScript applications where the base programming language lacks the high-level functionality that JavaScript offers.

            Despite the similarities in name and syntax, JavaScript is not related to the programming language Java. Though the names of both languages are trademarks of Oracle Corporation, the two languages follow different design principles, and are actively developed by unrelated organizations.

            avaScript is typically inserted into HTML when used on the web, either directly in the file in an HTML tag, or linked to a separate file containing the script.

            JavaScript, as a full featured scripting language, can be used to provide functionality to a website. Examples include:

        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Using AJAX in order to load content without refreshing the website.</li>
            <li>Changing HTML through the Document Object Model</li>
            <li>Changing CSS</li>
            <li>Validating inputs of forms and sending them.</li>
            <li>Tracking users as they move throughout the website.</li>
            
        </ul>
        <b>Frameworks</b>
        <p>
            A majority of websites use what is known as a framework. Frameworks may allow programming to be easier as more predefined procedures are defined within it. Such a library is jQuery.
