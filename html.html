        HTML A tags, also known as anchor tags, are often overlooked for more traditional internal linking methods.

<p>

        When incorporated into the code of a webpage, anchor tags and their attributes function as specialized hyperlinks that allow users to “jump” from one section of a webpage to another.

    <p>
        These hyperlinks are highly SEO- and user-friendly because they help educate search engines on the overall topic of a webpage, help keep code neat and organized in the backend, and enhance the user’s experience, because users do not need to scroll through slabs of text.
